
1) Data : 
	3, "mohan"

2) To use data, it must stored in some location -> memory address.
	To get the memory address -> we use id() function.
	In computer science, we generally use hexadecimal form of representation of memory address.

3) Data Type :
	Data type determines, what type of operation has to be performed on a Operator.

	Numeric Values :
		Add, sub, mul, athrithematic..

	Word(String) :
		concatenate, convert, extract substring

4) In Programming(General Programming languages), we have different data types :
		
	Category	Data Type	Example
	
1)	Numeric		int,		1, 2
			long		2385348756384578

2)	Numeric with
	Decimal Points	Float,		2.34
			Double		234.3458435793457

3)	Alphanumeric	char,		F, a, C
			String(group of characters is called String) vinay, mohan

4)	Boolean		Boolean		True, False


8 bits -> 1 byte

int -> 32 bits -> 4 bytes 

long -> 64 bits -> 8 bytes


5) In Python :
	
	Category	Data Type	Example

1)	Numeric		int,		234 
			long		3485634856384


2) 	Numeric with
	Decimal Points	Float		23485.873564237858

3) 	Alphanumeric	Char,		F, c D
			String		"Cow"

4)	Boolean		Boolean		True, False


6) Variables :
	Box without name -> doesn't give any meaning.
	Box with label -> give some meaning.

	Variable is the name assigned the Value(Data).

	I will refer to that value, holds that value.

	Input :
		num1 = 3
	process :
		num1 = num1 + 5
	Output :
		num1 -> 8

	Reserved keywords :

		We shouldn't use reserved keywords as Variables.
		
		a) if -> used to check the condition defining
		   else

		b) for,
		   While -> loop defining
	
		c) def -> fucntion defining

		d) print -> used to display the value in the console

		e) try,
		   except -> used for handling exception

		f) raise -> used fof raising the exception


	Variable Naming :
		
		x, y -> doesn't make a sence

		eg : age, carname


	Rules for Python variable defining :
		
		1) A variable name must start with a letter or underscore.

			eg : num, _name

		2) A variable cannot start with a number

			eg : 4name = "cow"

			     it will give "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"

		3) A variable must only contain :
				a) alphanumeric characters
				b) Underscores.

			ex :
				name4, _4name.

		
		4) Variable names are Case-Sensitive.
			
			ex : age, Age -> are different variables


7) Coding Standards :

	Google has come with Specific Coding standards for Different languages.

	For python :
		https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

		ex :
			variable name : var_name
			This format is known as "Snake case"

			ex : current_number_of_flights = 23

		ex :
			We should give comments for every fucntion we are writing.

			Other can understand the hidden functionality.

			

8) Comments :
	1) Multi line comment
	2) single line comment
