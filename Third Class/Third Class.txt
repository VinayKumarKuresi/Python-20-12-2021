		display("Seat are available in Air India")
	else if plane == "Luftansa":
		display("Seat are available in Luftansa")
	else:
		display("Seat are available in Emirates")

2) Input :
	A = 30
	B = 23
	C = 15

   Process :
	a is greater than b, c

	if a > b and a > c:

3) Flow of Control :
	1) Selection Structures :
		1) Single
		2) Multi

	2) Repetitive Structures :
		1) COnditional(Limit) Defining Repetitive Structures(For).
		2) Endless Repetitive Structure(While).

	Example :
		1) Passangers coming to Immigration Counter :
		   passenger = 1
		   display("Passanger Count,"passenger)
		   passenger = passenger  + 1
		   display("Passanger Count,"passenger)
		   passenger = passenger  + 1
		   display("Passanger Count,"passenger)


		2) Loop Example :
			passanger = 1
			seat_limit = 15
			for(var passenger = 1, passanger <= seat_limit, passenger = passenger  + 1):
				display("Passanger Count,"passenger)

		3) Loop Example :	
			Input : 
				A= 23
				B= 50

			Process :
			

			Output :
				Stop once A == B

4) While Loop :
	Example :
		1) Thread wheel should stop if baggage_count == 0

		baggage_count = 30

		while baggage_count > 0 :
			picked_up_count = input("Enter the picked up bags : ")
			baggage_count = baggage_count - picked_up_count 
			display("Remaning bags are : ", baggage_count)
