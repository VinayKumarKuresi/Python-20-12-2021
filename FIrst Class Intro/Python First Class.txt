
Python :
	1) Core Python
	2) Advanced Python

1) Python -> invented by Guido van rossum
	     1991

2) Flight Example :
	Boarding
		1) Checkiing the baggage
		2) Immigration check
		3) Security check
		4) Boardign
		5) Take off
	Landing ;
		1) Landing
		2) Immigration checking
		3) Security check
		4) Baggage collect
		5) Leave the airport

3) What is Program :	
	Set of instruction given to the computer is called program
	Act of creating program -> programming

4) Problem solving
	1) Input
	2) Process(Computing){Algorithm}
	3) Output

	Problem :
		Input(Air India) :
			In the morning -> at_the_start = 100
			After some time -> take_off = 40
			After some time -> landing_planes = 60
		Process :
			Current_no_of_flights = at_the_start - take_off + landing_planes 
					      = 100 - 40 + 60
                                              = 120
		
		Output : 	
			display(Current_no_of_flights) = 120

5) Representation of Algorithm :
	1) Pseudo-code -> representing the solution in Plain english
	2) Flow-chart -> representing the solution in a diagrammatic way

6) Variables :
	Is a container which store the data and hold the data, till the completion of the program

   Assignment Operator (=):
	Which will assign the data to -> variable.

7) Operators :
	Arithematic Operators :
		+	Add
		-	sub
		*	mul
		/	division
		%	modulus

	Relational Operators :
		==	Checking(Whether the values are equal or not)
			eg :	
				if equal:
					True
				else:
					False

		<	 less than
		>	greater than
		<=	less than or equal to
		>=	greater than or equal to

	Logical operators :
		
		AND
		OR
		NOT
		
		Resultant : True or False

		True -> T
		False -> F

		A	B 	A AND B

		T	T	T
		T	F	F
		F	T	F
		F	F	F

		A	B	A OR B
	
		T	T	T
		T	F	T
		F	T	T
		F	F	F

		A	NOTA
		T	F
		F	T


8) Flow of Control 
	1) Selection structures
	2) Repetitive structures

		1) Selection structures :
			1) Single selection statements
			
			eg :
				if runway == "free":
					display("You can land")
				else :
					display("should circle in AIR")		 

			2) Multi selection statements
			eg :
				if runway == "free":
					display("You can land")
				else if fuel == "low":
					display("Emergency landing")
				else :
					display("should circle in AIR")	


Assignment :
	1) Air India
	2) Emirates
	
	Input :
		yeswant_baggage = 30
		Air_India_baggage = 25
		Emirates_baggage = 40

	Process :
		Define a Algorithm

	Output
